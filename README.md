# Hippocampus

Hippocampus helps you store information you tend to forget.
For example: the birthday of your mother, that thee your wife likes, the address of that amazing restaurant.... etc...
Hippocampus can store anything that you want to remember.

Storing things to remember can assigned tags, allowing to search for it easily when you need it.
The better the tags assigned matched the content, the better the search results.

## Platform agnostic
Hippocampus is available for a wide variety of platforms:
	- Windows
	- Linux
	- MacOS
	- Android
	- FUTURE_WORK: iOS

## Synchronization
Hippocampus can synchronize with other Hippocampus installations.
Making it possible for you to have the same data on all your devices where you use the application.

### Hivemind
Synchronization happens by using [Hivemind](https://github.com/p-it-nl/hivemind).
This synchronization is stateless, Hivemind does not store any data, it will only transfer data.

## Privacy

One of the main reasons why Hippocampus has been created is to provide an useful application that does not impede on your privacy.
All data is only stored on your devices, there is no central database keeping track of anything.
Your data is yours and yours alone!

### Can I lose my data?

Yes, when you remove the application from all your devices, you also remove all your data.
As long as there is at least one Hippocampus application on any of your devices with data, your data is secure.
If you want, the application (not yet in Android) allows you to create a back-up file as an additional option to retain your data.

### Running without Hivemind

Using Hivemind is not mandatory. If Hivemind is not used, data is not synchronized with other Hippocampus installations that are in use by you.
Anything else in the application will work just the same, including generating back-ups.
